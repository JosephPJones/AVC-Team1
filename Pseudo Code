Main loop{
	While quadrant 4 is incomplete:{
		Check which quadrant robot is currently in and execute the related function
	}
}
Quadrant one{
	Drive along line using followLine function until in front of gate
	Stop at gate and send signal to arduino to open gate
	Wait for clear path
	Update current quadrant to quadrant 2
}
Quadrant two{
	Use followLine function until wide line is detected
	Update current quadrant to quadrant 3
}
Quadrant three{
	Use followLine until intersection is detected
	If a right turn is availible, take it
	Otherwise continue down line using followLine function
	Repeat until red patch signalling end of quadrant 3 detected
	Update curent quadrant to qudadrant four
}
Quadrant four{
Take readings from diagonal IR sensors to find position (sum) and angle (difference) in corridor
Adjust position according to readings, aiming to be going parallel to the wall to its right
Continue until red patch detected with camera.
Wait for gate to close
Wait for gate to open and continue with previous code until finish line detected
stop	
}
	Follow Line{
	Use camera to detect position and angle of line in front
Set turning speed based on horizontal position of line and motor power based on straightness of line
}
